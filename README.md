## The Typing Game

>  Have you ever wondered how fast can you type?
>  Now, you can check it with real time measurements.
>  **The Typing Game** provides you an opportunity to choose your own

## How Does It Work?

To begin your challenge, you need to go through the "Time Submittion" page.
Use "Next" and "Back" buttons to navigate through the app.

Once you are asked to submit your time, enter you choice (in seconds) and press "Submit".

To start the game, use "Next" to go to the "Game" page.
Good Luck!

> - React PropTypes
> - `react-router` - Routing 
> - `React Redux` -  Maintaining global state between components
> - ES6 logic
> - Material-UI (makeStyles, withStyles, useStyles)
